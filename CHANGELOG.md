# Changelog

All notable changes to this repo will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this repo uses a simple `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versioning scheme for public releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `plugins/regdatalab`: one plugin folder for Claude (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`) and ChatGPT/Codex (`plugin.json`, `mcp.json`, `.app.json`) with five read-only FDA research skills, pointing at the hosted endpoint and signing users in with OAuth (no keys in the package).
- Marketplaces: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (Claude) and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` (Codex/ChatGPT).
- `scripts/validate-plugins.js` and `test/plugins.test.js`: offline checks for both platforms' packaging rules, including negative cases.
- `docs/plugins/`: install/test guide and marketplace readiness checklist.

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed

- Replaced `mcp-remote` with a zero-dependency stdio-to-HTTP proxy. `mcp-remote@0.1.38` tried OAuth discovery and dynamic client registration before connecting, which crashed against servers using simple Bearer token auth. Every user who tried `npx -y fda-data-mcp` got a `ServerError` from `registerClient` and could not connect.

### Changed

- Removed `mcp-remote` dependency entirely. The wrapper is now ~150 lines of pure Node.js with zero npm dependencies.
- Bumped minimum Node.js version to 18 (for native `fetch`).

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- Wrapper-first setup guidance for Claude Desktop, Cowork, Cursor, Windsurf, and other stdio MCP clients.
- Clear signup messaging in the npm wrapper when `FDA_DATA_API_KEY` is missing, including the free-tier link and credits.
- Discovery metadata link in the public README so agents can find `/.well-known/mcp.json` quickly.
- Publish-ready `fda-data-mcp` npm wrapper package built on top of `mcp-remote`.
- Wrapper entrypoint and config helpers for stdio clients that need a local command instead of direct remote HTTP.
- A dedicated GitHub social preview image asset for repo sharing.

### Changed

- Made the wrapper the default setup path in the README instead of direct HTTP.
- Updated the VS Code install button and Smithery metadata to use `fda-data-mcp` directly.
- Removed stale README copy that still claimed the npm package had not been published.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- Homepage screenshot in the README so GitHub visitors can see the live product before they install it.
- Public trust and support files: `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, and GitHub issue-routing config.
- Marketplace metadata for hosted MCP discovery: `server.json`, `smithery.yaml`, and `glama.json`.
- Lightweight validation CI for metadata and canonical hosted endpoint references.
- GitHub Pages landing page that points to the canonical hosted docs instead of duplicating stale product copy.

### Changed

- Renamed the public repo from `fda-data-docs` to `fda-data-mcp`.
- Rewrote the README as a product landing page for the hosted FDA Data MCP.
- Standardized install guidance around the hosted MCP endpoint at `https://www.regdatalab.com/mcp`.
- Added quick-start instructions for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, generic MCP clients, and VS Code one-click install.
